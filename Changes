2009-04-06  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

2009-03-25  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- Updated version dependency for version.pm
	- Fixed a typo in the README

2009-03-16  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- Removed version-specific stuff from the README so I can be lazy (it was out-of-date anyway)

	- Removed prereq.t from the MANIFEST

2009-03-16  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

2009-03-14  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	Clarified licensing restrictions

2009-03-12  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- CIRCULAR.SKIP became out of sync with the real MANIFEST.SKIP, and so was causing problems with debian/
	- Increment the version to 1.1.2 for release again...

2009-03-12  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- Added "^debian/" as a mask for MANIFEST.SKIP. This is where Debian package control files go, and so should not be considered part of the package. Hopefully this won't break anything :-)
	- Upgraded to version 1.1.1

2009-03-12  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>
