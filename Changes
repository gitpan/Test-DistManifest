	Clarified licensing restrictions

2009-03-12  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- CIRCULAR.SKIP became out of sync with the real MANIFEST.SKIP, and so was causing problems with debian/
	- Increment the version to 1.1.2 for release again...

2009-03-12  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- Added "^debian/" as a mask for MANIFEST.SKIP. This is where Debian package control files go, and so should not be considered part of the package. Hopefully this won't break anything :-)
	- Upgraded to version 1.1.1
