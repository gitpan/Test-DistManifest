2009-10-12  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

2009-10-04  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	Changed my mail address to jawnsy@cpan.org

2009-08-20  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	Move CIRCULAR.SKIP and MANIFEST.EXTRA into t/

2009-08-19  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	Fixed line endings; they are all UNIX now

2009-08-19  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- Remove generated files from the repository
	- Use a simple string version, per David Golden's article: http://www.dagolden.com/index.php/369/version-numbers-should-be-boring/
	- No longer use Perl::Critic to test
	- Fixed test sequence

2009-07-25  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- Added coverage information
	- Rewrote LICENSE and README slightly

2009-07-25  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	Updated the checkmanifest.t example file and synopsis, it now checks Alias' flags (AUTOMATED_TESTING, RELEASE_TESTING) rather than TEST_AUTHOR

2009-07-25  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	No longer test Perl::Critic during AUTOMATED_TESTING, only RELEASE_TESTING. Thanks to Elliot Shank for the discussion in a private mail.

2009-07-25  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	Bump version to 1.2.3

2009-07-25  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- No more versioned dependency on version.pm
	- Use a generic README, no longer produce one

2009-07-25  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- Changed critic.rc to ignore PodSpelling policy (fixes a bug in Debian, BTS#538115 -- when Pod::Spell and other dependencies are installed)
	- Added generic README (no need to regenerate it)

2009-06-14  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	"one dot only" in filenames. This breaks compatibility with OpenVMS.

2009-06-14  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	Updated perlcriticrc with new preferences, removed "no critic" stuff for those in Test/DistManifest.pm

2009-06-13  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- Updated META.yml
	- Added copyleft statements to test files

2009-06-13  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	Minor documentation fix

2009-05-15  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	Small POD fix

2009-05-15  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	Minor problem forgetting to bump one of the version numbers in META.yml

2009-05-15  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- Bumped version to 1.2.2
	- Adjusted dependencies - changed minimum version dependency to Test::Builder 0.72 and version 0.74, which are core modules in Perl 5.10

2009-05-15  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	Oops, noted the version was bumped when it wasn't. Fixed now.

2009-05-15  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- Moved some small changes from MANIFEST.SKIP to CIRCULAR.SKIP
	- Bumped version to 1.2.1
	- This release is particularly important to get rid of Win32 test failures, where `Build.bat' is created instead of `Build'

2009-05-14  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	These were some pretty important changes, bumped the version to 1.2.0 instead

2009-05-14  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	Updated t/03warn-only.t test with new semantics (always fail if parsing fails)

2009-05-14  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- Note that circular dependencies and parsing errors will always be considered fatal, regardless of MANIFEST_WARN_ONLY
	- Suppress refactoring requirement - even though manifest_ok is really complex, it doesn't make sense to exist in separate subs

2009-05-14  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	Added t/03warn-only.t to MANIFEST

2009-05-14  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- Bumped version to 1.1.5
	- Added new feature for nonfatal errors (see updated POD)
	- Added tests for this new feature

	There a problem still some bugs to be worked out.

	Added Build.bat to MANIFEST.SKIP for Win32 builds...

2009-04-23  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- Added Win32 compatibility code. Closes the Win32 compatibility bug (RT#44401)
	- Updated Build.PL
	- Added META.yml
	- Changed to a passthrough Makefile instead of a classic one

2009-04-06  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	Updated META.yml

2009-03-25  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- Updated version dependency for version.pm
	- Fixed a typo in the README

2009-03-16  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- Removed version-specific stuff from the README so I can be lazy (it was out-of-date anyway)

2009-03-16  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- Removed prereq.t from the MANIFEST

2009-03-16  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- Removed use of Test::Prereq, because it needs to use CPAN to do its work

2009-03-16  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	Fix OS detection routines

2009-03-16  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- Enable svn:keywords: LastChangedBy Revision Id

2009-03-16  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- Updated 03core.t (header was old)
	- Fixed Test/DistManifest.pm (minor variable name change)

2009-03-16  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- Modified the module so that it works portably (even with Win32, and other platforms File::Spec supports)

2009-03-15  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- Added simple bug fix for MANIFEST testing under Windows.

2009-03-14  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	Updated prerequisite information in Build.PL and META.yml

2009-03-14  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- Add a more thorough description for the POD
	- Fix dependencies in Build.PL and META.yml

2009-03-14  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	Clarified licensing restrictions

2009-03-12  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- CIRCULAR.SKIP became out of sync with the real MANIFEST.SKIP, and so was causing problems with debian/
	- Increment the version to 1.1.2 for release again...

2009-03-12  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- Added "^debian/" as a mask for MANIFEST.SKIP. This is where Debian package control files go, and so should not be considered part of the package. Hopefully this won't break anything :-)
	- Upgraded to version 1.1.1

2009-03-12  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	Modified Changelog name to "Changes" (instead of CHANGES)

2009-03-12  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- Updated Makefile.PL
	- Removed CHANGES file; I plan to now generate the Changes from the svn log using gnuify-changelog.pl

2009-02-27  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

2009-02-26  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	Added the tests to MANIFEST

2009-02-20  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- Added some tests
	- Renamed MANIFEST.SKIP.CIRCULAR for portability; the new name is CIRCULAR.SKIP
	- TODO: rearrange the module so that it is possible to test the MANFIEST against files not actually on disk

2009-02-20  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	Updated version in README

2009-02-08  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- Updated to version 1.1.0
	- Updated the copyright date in POD
	- Fixed Makefile.PL with requires + build_requires deps (ignore the recommended, which are author tests)

2009-02-08  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- Added a test for circular dependencies (those that exist in both MANIFEST and MANIFEST.SKIP)
	- Updated core tests to match
